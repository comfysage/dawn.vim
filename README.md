# dawn.vim

## Motivation

A caliming colorscheme inspired by the vibrant colors of dawn.

Whilst working on dawn.vim i was inspired by the heavy documentation of [nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) and the creative presentation of [iceberg](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim) by [cocopon](https://github.com/cocopon/).

More documentation in the [docs](./docs/README.md).
