# dawn.vim

## Motivation

A calming colorscheme inspired by the vibrant colors of dawn.

Whilst working on dawn.vim I was inspired by the heavy documentation of [nord](https://www.nordtheme.com/) and the creative presentation of [iceberg](https://github.com/cocopon/iceberg.vim) by [cocopon](https://github.com/cocopon/).

More documentation in the [docs](./docs/README.md).

## Installation & Usage
If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) you can add this to your `.vimrc` / `init.vim`:

```Vim
Plug 'crispybaccoon/dawn.vim'

Then:

```Vim

colorscheme dawn
```
